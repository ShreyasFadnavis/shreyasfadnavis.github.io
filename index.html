      Machine learning, applied math, and the geometry of uncertainty.
    </p>
    <p class="bio">
      I did my PhD at Indiana University Bloomington, where I spent five years thinking about how to make noisy brain images less noisy&mdash;and accidentally built <a href="https://dipy.org">Patch2Self</a>, which became a NeurIPS spotlight. Then I crossed over to Harvard for a postdoc, where I traded cornfields for cobblestones and worked on multimodal machine learning and computational psychiatry.
    </p>
    <p class="bio">
      After that, I spent about two years at Johnson &amp; Johnson building foundational models for medical imaging&mdash;echocardiograms, endoscopy, the works. Had a brief stint as a principal at Hologic, just long enough to realize I wanted to build something of my own. Now I am at <a href="https://bioscope.ai">Bioscope AI</a>, doing things at the intersection of prediction, uncertainty, and whatever else catches my attention.
    </p>
    <p class="bio">
      I like conformal prediction, leverage scores, randomized numerical linear algebra, and problems where the math is beautiful and the applications are real. If that sounds like your kind of thing, you might enjoy the <a href="/blog/">writing</a>.
